# Steam Achievement Caretaker

Steam Achievement Caretaker is a lightweight, portable application used to manage
achievements and statistics in the PC gaming platform Steam. It requires the
[Steam client](https://store.steampowered.com/about/), a Steam account and network access.
Steam must be running and you must be logged in.

> **This project is based on [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager)
> (SAM) by Rick ([gibbed](https://github.com/gibbed)).** Caretaker is an altered source
> version of that software, distributed under the same zlib license. The original was
> released closed-source in 2008, saw its last major release in 2011, and was opened later
> so that those interested could do as they like with it. See
> [docs/ATTRIBUTION.md](docs/ATTRIBUTION.md) for the full lineage and licence position.

Caretaker carries a different name because it has diverged far enough to be a different
program: the two SAM executables were merged into one, the Windows Forms UI was replaced by
[Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/), the library and achievement lists are cached in SQLite
so neither window starts empty, and the game list was rebuilt around achievement
completion.

## How it works

There is one executable, `SteamAchievementCaretaker.exe`, and it has two faces:

| Start it… | and you get |
|---|---|
| with no arguments | **the library** — every game on your account, with how far through its achievements you are. The toolbar's view button switches between **Tiles** and **Content**. |
| with an app ID | **the editor** — the achievement and statistics editor for that one game. |

Picking a game in the library starts a second copy of the executable for it. That is not an
oversight: Steam's `ISteamUserStats` interface is scoped to the single app ID a process was
initialised with, so one process genuinely cannot serve both windows.

## Requirements

- The [Steam client](https://store.steampowered.com/about/), running and logged in
- The [.NET 10 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0) — unless you are
  using a self-contained build (see [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md))

### Linux

In addition to the .NET runtime, the UI needs a few system libraries that a minimal install
may not have:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libice6 libsm6
```

## Platform support

Caretaker loads Steam's own client library into its process, so the two must share a CPU
architecture. Valve ships that library for x86 and x64 only — there is no ARM build of the
Steam client on any platform.

| Download | Status |
|---|---|
| `win-x64` | Supported and tested |
| `win-x86` | Supported and tested |
| `linux-x64` | Supported and tested (Debian 13) |
| `osx-x64` | Should work; not yet tested |
| `win-arm64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-arm64` | Built, but **cannot talk to Steam** |

**On an Arm machine, download the x64 build.** Windows on Arm and Apple Silicon's Rosetta 2
will run it, and they are already emulating the Steam client itself. The arm64 bundles are
published only so the set is complete; they start up and tell you this rather than failing
in a confusing way.

## Where Caretaker keeps its files

Everything is stored under `~/.sac` — `C:\Users\<you>\.sac` on Windows,
`/home/<you>/.sac` on Linux, `/Users/<you>/.sac` on macOS.

If you are coming from Steam Achievement Manager, its `~/.sam` directory is **moved** to
`~/.sac` the first time Caretaker runs, so your cache and your like/dislike ratings carry
straight over. A cache location you had configured inside that directory is repointed at
the same time; one you had pointed somewhere else is left alone.

| File | What it holds | Movable |
|---|---|---|
| `settings.json` | where the database and icons are kept, and the chosen theme | no — it is read to find the others |
| `ratings.json` | your own like/dislike per game | no |
| `games.db` | owned games, their statistics, and each game's achievements | yes, from **Settings** |
| `icons/` | capsule art and achievement icons | yes, from **Settings** |

All of it is a cache or a local preference: delete any of it and Caretaker rebuilds it from
Steam on the next run, losing only your like/dislike ratings. **Nothing here is ever sent to
Steam.**

Your like/dislike is *not* your Steam review — Steam keeps review recommendations
server-side and does not expose them locally. If you are coming from SAM, an existing
`ratings.json` under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SteamAchievementManager\` is moved across the first
time Caretaker runs.

## Versioning

Current version: **1.0.0**. Caretaker restarts version numbering at 1.0; it succeeds Steam
Achievement Manager 8.0, and [docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md](docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md) records what
changed relative to SAM.

## What is different from Steam Achievement Manager

- **One executable instead of two.** `SAM.Picker.exe` and `SAM.Game.exe` are now a single
  `SteamAchievementCaretaker.exe` that chooses its window from the command line, and
  `SAM.API.dll` became `SteamAchievementCaretaker.SteamApi.dll`.
- **New Library layout.** The library window is a collections rail plus a grid that shows
  how far through each game's achievements you are; the editor pairs the achievement list
  with a detail pane, and gathers uncommitted changes into one bar so you can see what is
  about to be sent to Steam before you send it. Both follow the theme chosen in Settings.
- **All icons are vector,** so they take the theme's foreground colour and stay legible in
  dark mode. Earlier SAM releases used the Fugue Icons bitmaps.
- **Two library view modes.** *Tiles* shows capsule art with a completion meter. *Content*
  shows a row per game with a small icon, the name, release date, when you last played, the
  Steam review score, earned/total achievements, and your own like/dislike. Sort by any of
  those from the toolbar or by clicking a column header. This data is read from Steam's
  local caches, so it is only available for games Steam has already fetched data for;
  anything else shows `—`.
- **The library is cached, so the window opens straight away.** Games and their statistics
  go into a SQLite database at `~/.sac/games.db`, capsule art into `~/.sac/icons`. On launch
  the cached library is shown immediately while the list is re-checked against Steam in the
  background.
- **Achievements are cached too.** The first time you open a game, Caretaker waits for Steam
  and then stores that game's achievement list and its icons. After that the list appears as
  soon as the window does. Icons are only downloaded once.
- **Progress is shown while loading,** in both windows, instead of appearing to hang on a
  large library.
- **A theme setting.** **Settings → Appearance** offers *Follow system*, *Light* or *Dark*.
  The choice is previewed as you make it and remembered between runs; SAM always followed
  the system.
- **Migrated from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 10** and from Windows Forms to Avalonia. The
  interop layer was not rewritten.
- **64-bit support.** `steamclient64.dll` is loaded when running as a 64-bit process, and
  the projects build for `AnyCPU` as well as `x86`.
- **Cross-platform builds.** The interop layer no longer depends on `kernel32` or the
  Windows registry: it uses `NativeLibrary` and per-OS Steam path discovery, so the projects
  target plain `net10.0` and publish for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Support for the current `UserGameStatsSchema` format, alongside the older one.
- Achievement unlock times are shown in the editor.
- Fixed a long-standing bug in the `ISteamClient::GetISteamApps` interop signature, which
  was missing the `this` pointer. It went unnoticed for years in 32-bit builds but returns a
  null interface in 64-bit ones.

The full list, per release, is in [docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md](docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md).

## Building

Requires the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0); the exact
version is pinned in `global.json`. No Visual Studio installation is required.

```bash
dotnet build SteamAchievementCaretaker.slnx -c Release
```

The executable is written to `bin\` alongside the Avalonia assemblies and native libraries —
the whole directory is needed to run, not just the executable. Full instructions, including
32-bit, cross-platform and self-contained builds, are in [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md).
