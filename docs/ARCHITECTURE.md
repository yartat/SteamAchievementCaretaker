# Architecture

> Steam Achievement Caretaker is based on
> [Steam Achievement Manager](https://github.com/gibbed/SteamAchievementManager) by Rick
> (gibbed), and is an altered source version of it. The interop layer described below is
> substantially the original author's work. See [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).

This document describes how the application is put together and why. It is the condensed,
human-readable companion to [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md), which carries the same material at
greater length plus the rules a contributor or coding agent must not break.

## The two projects

| Project | Output | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `SteamAchievementCaretaker.SteamApi` | class library | All native interop with Steam. No package references of any kind, and no UI dependency. |
| `SteamAchievementCaretaker.App` | `SteamAchievementCaretaker.exe` | The whole application: the library window and the achievement editor. |

Both target plain `net10.0` — not `net10.0-windows`. The interop is written against
`NativeLibrary` rather than `kernel32`, and the Windows registry lookup is guarded by
`OperatingSystem.IsWindows()`.

## One executable, two windows

Steam's `ISteamUserStats` interface is **scoped to the single application ID the process was
initialised with**. A process that called `Initialize(0)` to enumerate the library cannot
then ask Steam for one game's achievements. That constraint, not packaging taste, is why
Steam Achievement Manager shipped two executables.

Caretaker ships one executable and keeps the constraint:

| Command line | Window | `Client.Initialize` |
|---|---|---|
| *(no arguments)* | `GamePickerWindow` — the library | app ID `0` |
| `<appid>` | `ManagerWindow` — the achievement editor | that app ID |

`Program.TryParseAppId` reads the command line, `App.CreateMainWindow` does the Steam
handshake and picks the window, and `Program.LaunchForApp` starts a second copy of the same
executable (`Environment.ProcessPath`) when the user opens a game.

A consequence worth remembering: two processes hold the same SQLite database open. The
schema uses `journal_mode=WAL` and the achievement cache sets a command timeout so overlap
is a wait rather than a `SQLITE_BUSY`.

## The interop layer

No Steamworks SDK is involved. The entire native surface is reimplemented:

1. `Steam.Load()` asks `SteamPlatform` for the Steam install path and the candidate client
   library paths for this OS and bitness, loads the first one that exists with
   `NativeLibrary.TryLoad`, and binds three exports: `CreateInterface`,
   `Steam_BGetCallback`, `Steam_FreeLastCallback`.
2. `Steam.CreateInterface<T>("SteamClient018")` returns a raw pointer to a C++ object.
3. `NativeWrapper<TFunctions>.SetupFunctions` treats that pointer as a one-field
   `NativeClass` and marshals its virtual table into a `struct` of `IntPtr` fields — one
   field per virtual method, in declaration order.
4. Calls go through `Call<TReturn, TDelegate>`, which turns the slot into a delegate with
   `Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer` (cached) and invokes it. Instance methods are
   declared `[UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.ThisCall)]` with the object pointer
   passed explicitly as the first argument.

### Four things that must not change

1. **Vtable field order is an ABI contract.** Every field is an `IntPtr`; the order is the
   only thing carrying meaning. Reordering silently calls the wrong function. Deprecated
   slots stay as `DEPRECATED_*` placeholders for this reason.
2. **Interface version strings must match the struct they are marshalled into.** The string
   passed to `CreateInterface` selects which vtable Steam hands back.
3. **Every vtable delegate needs `ThisCall` and an explicit `IntPtr self` parameter.**
   These are C++ member functions. On x86 a missing `this` went unnoticed for years because
   the remaining arguments still landed at the expected stack offsets; on x64 every argument
   shifts by one and Steam returns a null interface.
4. **A C++ method returning a struct by value needs a per-platform declaration.** MSVC
   returns it through a hidden pointer argument; System V AMD64 returns a small POD in RAX.
   `ISteamUser::GetSteamID()` is the one case today, and getting it wrong on Linux returns
   0 rather than throwing — which silently poisons everything keyed off the account ID.

### Callbacks

Steam answers by callback, not return value. `Client.RunCallbacks` drains
`Steam_BGetCallback` and dispatches by numeric ID to registered `ICallback` instances. Both
view models pump it from a 200 ms Avalonia `DispatcherTimer`, so callbacks arrive on the UI
thread. `RefreshStats` only *requests*; `OnUserStatsReceived` is where the editor actually
populates itself.

## The UI layer

`Program.Main` builds the Avalonia `AppBuilder`;
`App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted` does the Steam handshake and chooses the main
window — the library, the editor, or a `MessageWindow` carrying the error. Avalonia has no
`MessageBox`, so `Views/MessageWindow.cs` is a hand-rolled stand-in that doubles as the main
window when the handshake fails.

View models hold all logic and every Steam call; views are XAML plus thin code-behind.
Because view models have no window to parent a dialog to, they raise `ErrorRaised`,
`MessageRaised` and `ConfirmRequested` events and the window shows the dialog.

Bindings are compiled, so binding typos are build errors. **Resource lookups are not.**
`{StaticResource Foo}` with no `Foo`, a `StyleInclude` pointing nowhere, or a property fed a
resource of the wrong type all compile cleanly and throw when the window opens — which is
why the headless render check described in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#verifying-a-build) is worth
running after any XAML change.

Theming lives in `Resources/Theme.axaml` as a `ResourceDictionary` with `ThemeDictionaries`
for Light and Dark. Which one is used comes from `AppSettings.Theme` — *Follow system*,
*Light* or *Dark*, chosen in Settings and applied in
`App.OnFrameworkInitializationCompleted`. *Follow system* is `ThemeVariant.Default`, which
means Avalonia keeps tracking the OS setting rather than pinning a palette.

The variant can therefore change while a window is open, both from the OS and from the
Settings dialog, which previews a selection immediately and reverts it on Cancel. Every
themed brush must be referenced with `{DynamicResource}`, never `{StaticResource}`.

Each of the two processes reads the setting for itself, so a theme changed in Settings
reaches an achievement editor that is already open only when it is reopened.

Every icon is a `StreamGeometry` in `Resources/Icons.axaml` rendered through a `PathIcon`,
drawn on a shared 16×16 grid and sized by a single style. There are no icon bitmaps.

## Where the library numbers come from

The library window cannot ask Steam for another game's achievements — see
[One executable, two windows](#one-executable-two-windows). `Library/LibraryStats.cs`
therefore reads Steam's own on-disk caches:

| Number | Source |
|---|---|
| Total achievements | `appcache/stats/UserGameStatsSchema_<appid>.bin` |
| Earned achievements | `appcache/stats/UserGameStats_<accountid>_<appid>.bin` — a popcount of the `data` bitfield masked to the bits the schema defines |
| Playtime, last played | `userdata/<accountid>/config/localconfig.vdf` |
| Steam rating, release date | `SteamApps001.GetAppData` (`review_percentage`, `review_score`, `steam_release_date`) |
| Your like/dislike | `~/.sac/ratings.json` — **not** from Steam, and never sent to it |

Two things to keep in mind:

- The file names use the **32-bit account ID** (`steamId & 0xFFFFFFFF`), not the 64-bit
  SteamID.
- Coverage is partial: Steam only writes these caches for games it has actually fetched or
  run. **Unknown and zero are different answers** — a game with no cached schema shows no
  completion meter at all, rather than an empty one.

These numbers were validated against the live API (`RequestUserStats` +
`GetAchievementAndUnlockTime`) and matched exactly. If the parsing changes, re-validate the
same way; a plausible-looking wrong number here is worse than no number.

## Caching

Neither window starts empty.

| Store | Holds |
|---|---|
| `games` table | the owned game list and its statistics |
| `achievements` table | each visited game's achievement list and unlock state, keyed by account ID **and** language |
| `<appid>.img` | capsule art |
| `<appid>_<icon>` | achievement icons |

The database and icon directory default under `~/.sac` and are relocatable from Settings;
`settings.json` and `ratings.json` are not, because `settings.json` is the file that would
have to be read to find them.

Startup order is deliberate in both windows: the cached read runs **synchronously** in the
constructor, so the window paints with content before any network or Steam work starts; the
background refresh then merges live data in rather than clearing and rebuilding, which would
blank the window and re-download every image.

The achievement icon file naming is load-bearing: `IconCache.Prune` recovers the app ID from
the file name to delete art for games no longer owned, and files whose name yields no app ID
are left alone entirely, because the directory is user-chosen and may not be ours.

## Pending changes in the editor

`_PendingStates` — uncommitted toggles by achievement ID — is the model. The visible
`Achievements` collection is only what the search box and filter last left on screen.
Keeping the two separate fixes two real bugs: changing a filter used to discard every
pending toggle, and a change made before switching filters was never committed.

Three rules keep it honest: Steam's last-known states are cached so the list can be rebuilt
without asking Steam again; a toggle back to Steam's value removes the entry rather than
storing a no-op, so the count is the number of real changes; and re-reading Steam clears
pending, because anything toggled against the *cached* list was toggled against unconfirmed
state.

## Threading

Downloads are `async`/`HttpClient` on the UI thread's synchronization context, so
continuations come back on the UI thread and nothing needs marshalling.

The one deliberate exception is the ownership sweep in `GamePickerViewModel.LoadGamesAsync`,
wrapped in `Task.Run`: it makes two Steam calls per app ID across the whole published game
list, so it cannot run on the UI thread. **Steam client calls therefore do happen off the UI
thread there** — preserved deliberately from the original, not an invitation to add more.

Image downloads use a single-consumer queue, one at a time.

## What is not covered here

`CLAUDE.md` carries the longer form, including the reasoning behind decisions that look
arbitrary, the .NET Core migration traps, and the current list of known issues.
