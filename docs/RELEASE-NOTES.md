## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-21

The first Caretaker release. It is SAM 8.0 restructured into a single application and
renamed, plus a theme setting and a new icon. **Nothing changed in what the tool does to
your Steam account** — the interop layer was carried over untouched.

### Highlights

- One executable, `SteamAchievementCaretaker.exe`, instead of `SAM.Picker.exe` and
  `SAM.Game.exe`.
- A theme setting: **Settings → Appearance** offers *Follow system*, *Light* or *Dark*.
- A new application icon — Steam's gear carrying an achievement star — with entries up to
  256px, so it no longer blurs in Explorer or Alt-Tab.
- Two projects and a `.slnx` solution in place of three projects and a `.sln`.
- Settings and caches now live in `~/.sac`. An existing Steam Achievement Manager `~/.sam`
  directory is moved across on first run, so nothing is lost.

### Downloads

Each download is a folder, not a single file: the executable needs the Avalonia assemblies
and the native Skia libraries beside it.

| If you are on | Take |
|---|---|
| 64-bit Windows | `win-x64` |
| 32-bit Windows | `win-x86` |
| Debian or Ubuntu (amd64) | the `.deb` — `sudo apt install ./steam-achievement-caretaker_1.0.0_amd64.deb` |
| Any other Linux | `linux-x64` |
| macOS (Intel) | `osx-x64` — builds, but has never been run |
| Windows on Arm, Apple Silicon | `win-x64` / `osx-x64`, **not** the arm64 bundles |

The arm64 bundles exist only so the build matrix is complete. Valve ships no ARM build of
the Steam client on any platform, and Caretaker loads that client into its own process, so
an arm64 build starts and then tells you it cannot talk to Steam. Emulation runs the x64
bundle fine — it is already emulating Steam itself.

A framework-dependent bundle needs the
[.NET 10 Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0). On Linux it
also needs three system libraries that a minimal install may not have:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libfontconfig1 libice6 libsm6
```

### Upgrading from Steam Achievement Manager

Caretaker keeps its settings and caches in `~/.sac`. **The first time it runs, an existing
`~/.sam` directory is moved there** — `settings.json`, `ratings.json`, `games.db` and
`icons/` — so your cached library, your cache locations and your own like/dislike ratings
carry over with nothing to do by hand. A cache location you had configured *inside* that
directory is repointed at the same time; one you had pointed somewhere else is left alone.

Coming from a build older than `~/.sam`, a `ratings.json` under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SteamAchievementManager\` is moved across as well.

Two things to know:

- **It is a move, not a copy.** If you keep Steam Achievement Manager installed, it will
  find `~/.sam` gone and start again with an empty cache. Nothing is destroyed — SAM will
  rebuild its own — but your like/dislike ratings now belong to Caretaker.
- If `~/.sac` already exists, nothing is moved and `~/.sam` is left exactly as it is. The
  two never merge.

Caretaker does not uninstall or modify a SAM install beyond that one move.

### Renamed and restructured

- **The project is now Steam Achievement Caretaker**, based on Steam Achievement Manager.
  The attribution is carried in every source file header, in the assembly `Copyright` and
  `Description` properties, and in all documentation.
- **One executable instead of two.** `SAM.Picker.exe` and `SAM.Game.exe` were merged into
  `SteamAchievementCaretaker.exe`, which shows the library window when started with no
  arguments and the achievement editor when started with an app ID.

  Picking a game still starts a **second process**, now a second copy of the same
  executable. That part was never a packaging choice: Steam's `ISteamUserStats` interface
  is scoped to the one app ID a process was initialised with, so one process cannot serve
  both windows.
- **Two projects instead of three.** `SAM.API` became
  `SteamAchievementCaretaker.SteamApi`; `SAM.Picker`, `SAM.Game` and the linked `Shared/`
  folder became `SteamAchievementCaretaker.App`, organised into `Common/`, `Library/`,
  `Achievements/`, `ViewModels/`, `Views/` and `Resources/`.

  The `Shared/*.cs` link machinery is gone — one assembly needs no links, and the shared
  icon set no longer has to be given a matching `avares` path in two places.
- **Namespaces** are now `SteamAchievementCaretaker.SteamApi*` and
  `SteamAchievementCaretaker.App*`.
- **The settings and cache directory is now `~/.sac`**, not `~/.sam`. An existing `~/.sam`
  is moved there on first run and any cache location that pointed inside it is repointed,
  so nothing has to be done by hand. See
  [Upgrading from Steam Achievement Manager](#upgrading-from-steam-achievement-manager).
- **The solution is `SteamAchievementCaretaker.slnx`**, in the XML `.slnx` format. The old
  `.sln` was removed. The solution carries a `Documentation` folder with the README, the
  licence and everything under `docs/`.
- **Duplicated files were merged**, not copied: one `MessageWindow` (the editor's version,
  which supports confirmation dialogs, plus the library's taskbar and null-owner handling),
  one `InvariantShorthand`, one `App.axaml`, one `GlobalSuppressions.cs`, one application
  icon and one manifest.
- **Documentation was split out** into `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/BUILD.md`,
  `docs/RELEASE-NOTES.md` and `docs/ATTRIBUTION.md`.
- Two unreferenced PNG assets left over from the Windows Forms era
  (`poop-smiley-sad.png`, `poop-smiley-sad-enlarged.png`) were dropped, along with the
  unused `Blank.ico` and `Pink.ico`.

### New

- **A Debian package.** `steam-achievement-caretaker_1.0.0_amd64.deb` installs to
  `/usr/lib/steam-achievement-caretaker` with a menu entry and an icon, and is
  **self-contained** — it bundles the .NET runtime, so it needs nothing from Microsoft's
  apt repository. The Windows zips stay framework-dependent and want the .NET 10 Desktop
  Runtime.
- **New application icon** — Steam's gear carrying an achievement star, in the gold the
  dark theme already uses. It replaces the inherited SAM icon, which had only 16, 32 and
  48px entries; the new one goes up to 256, so it stays sharp in Explorer's large-icon
  views and the Alt-Tab switcher. The 16px entry is drawn separately rather than
  downscaled, because the gear teeth do not survive at that size. The vector master is
  `docs/assets/app-icon.svg`.
- **Theme setting.** **Settings → Appearance** chooses *Follow system*, *Light* or *Dark*,
  stored in `~/.sac/settings.json` as `Theme`. The dialog applies the choice immediately so
  you can see it, and puts the previous one back if you cancel. *Follow system* is the
  default and is what the application did before.

  Because the library window and the achievement editor are separate processes, each reads
  the setting at startup: a change made in Settings reaches an editor window that is already
  open only when that window is reopened.

### Fixed

- **Publishing the 32-bit build produced a mixed-architecture bundle.** `dotnet publish
  -r win-x86` resolves 32-bit native libraries but still emits a *64-bit* apphost, so the
  result died inside SkiaSharp's type initializer with nothing printed — it looked like the
  application simply failed to start. Building 32-bit needs `-p:Platform=x86` as well, which
  is what the `bin/x86` build always did; only the publish path was wrong. CI now asserts
  the architecture of every Windows bundle before packaging it.
- Changing a cache location used to abandon the whole settings save when the move failed.
  The theme, which does not depend on the move, is now saved either way, and the error says
  the cache was left where it was.

### Unchanged on purpose

- **The interop layer was not rewritten.** The vtable marshalling, the interface layouts
  and the callback pump are SAM's, carried over with renames only.
- **Nothing is sent to Steam that was not sent before.** Your like/dislike stays local.

### Verified in this release

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `dotnet build` on `AnyCPU` and `x86`, warnings as errors | 0 warnings, 0 errors |
| Library window against a live, logged-in Steam client (win-x64) | opens, lists the real library |
| Achievement editor for one game (win-x64, app ID 105600) | opens |
| All three windows constructed and rendered headless | pass |
| Light and Dark render differently | pass, compared pixel by pixel |
| `Theme` read back from `settings.json` at startup | pass |
| Directory migration, four cases on Debian with `HOME` redirected | move, repoint, ratings and icons preserved; no-op when `~/.sac` exists; a cache pointed outside `~/.sam` left alone |
| Icon embedded in the executable | 32px entry identical to the master artwork |
| Whole pipeline run in the CI image | all three artifacts produced |
| GitHub Actions workflows linted with `actionlint` (shellcheck included) | clean |
| GitHub workflow shell logic run end to end in a container | same three artifacts, correct architectures |
| Both Windows bundles unzipped and launched against live Steam | win-x64 and win-x86 both open |
| `.deb` installed on a stock Debian 13 | installs with no extra packages, `dpkg -V` clean |
| Application launched from that install under Xvfb | runs, nothing on stderr |
| `lintian` | clean apart from tags inherent to a self-contained .NET bundle |

Not exercised: Steam interop on Linux — the Debian run had no Steam client, so it was only
proved to start. The macOS bundles were not built or run. See also the write path under
Known issues.

### Known issues

Carried forward and still open:

- The **write path** — `SetAchievement`, `SetStatValue`, `StoreStats`, `ResetAllStats` — has
  not been re-verified against a live account since the .NET 10 migration. It mutates a real
  Steam account, so exercise it on a throwaway title first.
- `SteamClient018.GetSteamUtils004` requests `"SteamUtils004"` but marshals the result as
  `ISteamUtils005`. It does not crash, and it predates every migration here, but it bends
  the rule that a version string must match the struct it is marshalled into.
- The capsule-art download queue is eager rather than visible-only, because Avalonia's
  `WrapPanel` does not virtualize.
- Orphaned `achievements` rows are never pruned when a game stops being owned.
- Moving the cache from **Settings** while an editor window is open can fail on Windows,
  because that process holds its own connection to the same database.
- The version appears in the two window titles as a literal rather than coming from the
  assembly version, so a release has to update both by hand. See the checklist in
  [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).
- The licence position is unresolved: the repository carries both an MIT `LICENSE` for the
  new work and the upstream zlib `LICENSE.txt`, which the derived code is bound by. See
  [ATTRIBUTION.md](ATTRIBUTION.md).

## Background: inherited from Steam Achievement Manager 8.0

These changes were made in SAM before the fork. They are listed here because they are what
Caretaker 1.0 is built on, not because they are new in it.

- **New Library layout.** The game list became a collections rail plus a grid showing how
  far through each game's achievements you are; the editor pairs the achievement list with
  a detail pane, and gathers uncommitted changes into one bar so you can see what is about
  to be sent to Steam before you send it.
- **All icons are vector.** The toolbars use drawn geometries rather than bitmaps, so they
  take the theme's foreground colour and stay legible in dark mode. Earlier releases used
  the Fugue Icons bitmaps.
- **Two view modes.** *Tiles* shows capsule art with a completion meter. *Content* shows a
  row per game with a small icon, the name, release date, when you last played, the Steam
  review score, earned/total achievements, and your own like/dislike. This data comes from
  Steam's local caches, so it is only available for games Steam has already fetched data
  for; anything else shows `—`.
- **Your own like/dislike,** stored in the home directory as `ratings.json`. It is *not* your Steam review
  — Steam does not expose that locally — and nothing is ever sent to Steam.
- **The library is cached, so the window opens straight away.** Games and their statistics
  go into a SQLite database at `games.db`, capsule art into `icons/`. The
  cached library is shown immediately while the list is re-checked against Steam in the
  background; games no longer owned are dropped and new ones added.
- **Achievements are cached too.** After the first visit to a game, its achievement list
  appears as soon as the window does, and is refreshed from Steam in the background. Icons
  are downloaded once.
- **Progress is shown while loading** in both windows, instead of appearing to hang on a
  large library.
- **Migrated from .NET Framework 4.8 to .NET 10.** The default `AnyCPU` build runs as a
  64-bit process and talks to the 64-bit Steam client; build the `x86` configuration if you
  need a 32-bit process.
- **Migrated from Windows Forms to [Avalonia](https://avaloniaui.net/).** The interop layer
  was unchanged; only the UI was rewritten.
- **Cross-platform builds.** The interop layer no longer depends on `kernel32` or the
  Windows registry: it uses `NativeLibrary` and per-OS Steam path discovery, so the projects
  target plain `net10.0` and publish for Windows, Linux and macOS.
- Support for the current `UserGameStatsSchema` format, alongside the older one.
- Achievement unlock times are shown in the editor.
- Fixed a long-standing bug in the `ISteamClient::GetISteamApps` interop signature, which
  was missing the `this` pointer. It went unnoticed for years in 32-bit builds but returns a
  null interface in 64-bit ones.
- Fixed `ISteamUser::GetSteamID` on Linux and macOS, where System V AMD64 returns a small
  struct in a register rather than through a hidden pointer. The Windows form silently
  returned 0, poisoning every lookup keyed off the account ID.
