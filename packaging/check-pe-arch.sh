#
# Fails unless the apphost and the native libraries in a published Windows
# directory are all the architecture the runtime identifier asks for.
#
# This exists because getting it wrong is silent. `dotnet publish -r win-x86`
# alone resolves 32-bit native libraries but can still emit a 64-bit apphost;
# the result runs far enough to load SkiaSharp and then dies in its type
# initializer, with nothing on stdout or stderr to say why. Building 32-bit
# needs -p:Platform=x86 as well as -r win-x86 - see docs/BUILD.md.
