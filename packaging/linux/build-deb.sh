# Builds a .deb from an already-published linux-x64 directory.
#
#   ./build-deb.sh --publish-dir publish/linux-x64 --version 1.0.0 --output dist
#
# The publish must be SELF-CONTAINED. A framework-dependent build would have to
# declare Depends: dotnet-runtime-10.0, which only exists in Microsoft's own apt
# repository - so `apt install ./steam-achievement-caretaker_*.deb` would fail
# with an unmet dependency on a stock Debian or Ubuntu. Bundling the runtime
# costs about 100 MB and makes the package install with nothing else added.
#
# Needs: dpkg-deb (>= 1.19, for --root-owner-group), gzip, and coreutils.
