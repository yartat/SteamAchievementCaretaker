# Prints the version to build, as a dotenv line: VERSION=<x.y.z>.
#
# On a tag it is the tag with any leading "v" removed, and the tag must agree
# with the version in the projects and in the window titles - see
# check-version.sh, which this script calls. Off a tag it is the project
# version with a "~dev" suffix, which sorts *before* the release in both dpkg
# and semver order, so a development build can never look newer than a release.
#
# Reads GitLab's and GitHub's tag variables both, so one script and one version
# gate serve both pipelines.
