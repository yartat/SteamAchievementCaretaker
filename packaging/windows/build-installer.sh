# Builds the Windows installer from an already-published directory.
#
#   ./build-installer.sh --publish-dir out/win-x64 --version 1.0.0 --arch x64
#
# The publish must be SELF-CONTAINED. The installer offers no way to fetch the
# .NET runtime, and an installed application that reports a missing runtime is
# a worse first run than a larger download.
#
# Needs: makensis (Debian/Ubuntu package `nsis`). No Windows machine and no Wine
# are involved - NSIS cross-compiles the installer stub.
